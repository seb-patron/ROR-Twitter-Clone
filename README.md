# Twitter Clone README

![Alt text](twitter_clone.pngraw=true "Twitter Clone")
This app is a clone of Twitter written in Ruby on Rails.

A few key things about this app:

It includes User authentication with Devise. Devise has also been extended to include a User's name and twitter handle (which is unique)

Steps were added to insure that only the user who created a tweet can delete it

The Tachyons CSS framework is used for styling.
